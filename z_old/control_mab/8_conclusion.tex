\section{Conclusion}

We have formulated model selection for deformable object manipulation as a MAB problem. Our formulation enables the application of existing MAB algorithms to deformable object manipulation as well as introduces a novel \textit{utility} metric to measure how useful a model is at performing a given task. We have also presented Kalman Filtering for Non-stationary Multi-arm Normal Dependent Bandits (KF-MANDB) to leverage coupling between dependent bandits to learn more from each arm pull. Our experiments show how to perform several interesting simulated tasks for rope and cloth using our method.  In future work we seek to integrate our approach with sensing and planning systems and show applications on real-world tasks. We also seek to explore how to use the predictive accuracy of each model as an additional measure of model coupling.
