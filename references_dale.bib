	feasibility constraints, solve the easier version of the problem,

	problem. We show how this strategy can be applied to rigid bodies
	and to linkages with high degrees of freedom, including both open
	and closed chain systems. Experimental results are presented for
	linkages composed of 9-98 links. Although we use PRMs as the automated

  abstract = {A new motion planning method for robots in static workspaces is presented.
	This method proceeds in two phases: a learning phase and a query
	phase. In the learning phase, a probabilistic roadmap is constructed
	and stored as a graph whose nodes correspond to collision-free configurations
	and whose edges correspond to feasible paths between these configurations.
	These paths are computed using a simple and fast local planner. In
	the query phase, any given start and goal configurations of the robot
	are connected to two nodes of the roadmap; the roadmap is then searched
	for a path joining these two nodes. The method is general and easy
	to implement. It can be applied to virtually any type of holonomic
	robot. It requires selecting certain parameters (e.g., the duration
	of the learning phase) whose values depend on the scene, that is
	the robot and its workspace. But these values turn out to be relatively
	easy to choose, Increased efficiency can also be achieved by tailoring
	some components of the method (e.g., the local planner) to the considered
	robots. In this paper the method is applied to planar articulated
	robots with many degrees of freedom. Experimental results show that
	path planning can be done in a fraction of a second on a contemporary

	grips. Static hand posture was measured by recording the angular
	position of 15 joint angles of the fingers and of the thumb. Although
	subjects adopted distinct hand shapes for the various objects, the
	joint angles of the digits did not vary independently. Principal
	components analysis showed that the first two components could account

	they were small, higher-order (more than three) principal components

	information about the object. These results suggest that the control
	of hand posture involves a few postural synergies, regulating the
	general shape of the hand, coupled with a finer control mechanism
	providing for small, subtle adjustments. Because the postural synergies

	It explores the task space for end-effector paths satisfying given

abstract = {A fundamental property of rough-terrain motion planning is that each configuration of the robot on the terrain can be assigned a characteristic navigational difficulty based on the terrain topography and physical properties of the underground. This measure is computed in an application-dependent manner based on the properties of the robot and terrain model employed. In this work we propose a motion planner based on rapidly exploring random trees (RRTs) which takes into consideration the characteristics of the underground. In the suggested solution, the randomised expansion of the RRTs is biased towards regions of low navigational difficulty. The motion planner generates trajectories which follow areas of easy navigation and only deviates to harder regions where inevitable. In particular, the maximal difficulty on the path is approximately minimised. For single-query motion planning tasks, bidirectional RRTs have proven to be effective in rapidly computing a path between the initial and goal configurations. To deal with complex distributions of the terrain characteristics, this concept has been extended. Rooted at randomly chosen configurations, a number of additional RRTs is grown. While the algorithm discussed is intended for rough-terrain motion planning and demonstrated in this context, it can easily be adapted to other domains where a characteristic measure for the desirability of attaining individual configurations can be defined},

We validate the architecture through a series of experiments, in which a human demonstrator teaches a humanoid robot simple manipulatory tasks. A probability-based estimation of the relevance is suggested by first projecting the motion data onto a generic latent space using principal component analysis. The resulting signals are encoded using a mixture of Gaussian/Bernoulli distributions (Gaussian mixture model/Bernoulli mixture model). This provides a measure of the spatio-temporal correlations across the different modalities collected from the robot, which can be used to determine a metric of the imitation performance. The trajectories are then generalized using Gaussian mixture regression. Finally, we analytically compute the trajectory which optimizes the imitation metric and use this to generalize the skill to different contexts.},

This paper presents a hybrid sampling strategy in the PRM framework for finding paths through narrow passages. A key ingredient of the new strategy is the bridge test, which boosts the sampling density inside narrow passages. The bridge test relies on simple tests of local geometry and can be implemented efficiently in high-dimensional configuration spaces. The strengths of the bridge test and uniform sampling complement each other naturally and are combined to generate the final hybrid sampling strategy. Our planner was tested on point robots and articulated robots in planar workspaces. Preliminary experiments show that the hybrid sampling strategy enables relatively small roadmaps to reliably capture the connectivity of configuration spaces with difficult narrow passages.},

This paper presents a new method of dilation by shrinking the geometric models of robots and obstacles. Compared with existing work, the new method is more efficient in both running time and memory usage. It is also integrated with collision checking, a key operation in PRM planning. The efficiency of the dilation method enables a new PRM planner which quickly constructs a series of dilated free spaces and automatically determine the amount of dilation needed. Experiments show that both the dilation method and the planner work well in complex geometric environments. In particular, the planner reliably solved the most difficult version of the alpha puzzle, a benchmark test for PRM planners},

title="Motion Planning for Robotic Manipulation of Deformable Linear Objects",
bookTitle=ISER,
year="2008",
publisher="Springer Berlin Heidelberg",
address="Berlin, Heidelberg",
pages="23--32",
abstract="A new motion planner is described to manipulate deformable linear objects (DLOs) and tie knots (both self-knots and knots around static objects) using two cooperating robotic arms. This planner blends new ideas with pre-existing concepts and techniques from knot theory, motion planning, and computational modeling. Unlike in traditional motion planning, the planner's goal is a topological state of the DLO rather than some exact geometry. Using an input physical model of the DLO, it searches for a maniplation path by constructing a topologically-biased probabilistic roadmap in the configuration space of the DLO. Static needles are inserted to ensure the integrity of loops of the DLO during manipulation and to make plans robust to imperfections in the physical model. The planner was tested both in simulation and on a dual-PUMA-560 hardware platform to achieve various knots, like bowline, neck-tie, bow (shoe-lace), and stun-sail.",

@article{Navarro-Alarcon2014,
abstract = {In this paper, we address the active deformation control of compliant objects by robot manipulators. The control of deformations is needed to automate several important tasks, for example, the manipulation of soft tissues, shaping of food materials, or needle insertion. Note that in many of these applications, the object's deformation properties are not known. To cope with this issue, in this paper we present two new visual servoing approaches to explicitly servo-control elastic deformations. The novelty of our kinematic controllers lies in its uncalibrated behavior; our adaptive methods do not require the prior identification of the object's deformation model and the camera's intrinsic/extrinsic parameters. This feature provides a way to automatically control deformations in a model-free manner. The experimental results that we report validate the feasibility of our controllers.},

We present a method, which we call trajectory transfer, for adapting a demonstrated trajectory from the geometry at training time to the geometry at test time. Trajectory transfer is based on nonrigid registration, which computes a smooth transformation from the training scene onto the testing scene.

@article{Brass2015,
abstract = {We consider the problem of finding the shortest path for a tethered robot in a planar environment with polygonal obstacles of n total vertices. The robot is attached to an anchor point by a tether of finite length. The robot can cross the tether; i.e., the tether can be self-intersecting. Neither the robot nor the tether may enter the interior of any obstacle. The initial tether configuration is given as a polyline of k vertices. If the tether is automatically retracted and kept taut, we present an O(kn2log⁡n) time algorithm to find the shortest path between the source and the destination point. This improves the previous O(lkn3) time algorithm [24], where l is the number of loops in the initial tether configuration. If the tether can only be retracted while the robot backtracks along the tether, we present an algorithm to find the shortest path in O((n+log⁡k)log⁡n) time.},

Furthermore, within this object classification, we divide the approaches based on the particular task they perform on the deformable object. Finally, we conclude this survey with a discussion of the current state-of-the-art approaches and propose future directions within the proposed classification. }

The control of deformations is needed to automate several important tasks, for example, the manipulation of soft tissues, shaping of food materials, or needle insertion. Note that in many of these applications, the object's deformation properties are not known. To cope with this issue, in this paper we present two new visual servoing approaches to explicitly servo-control elastic deformations. The novelty of our kinematic controllers lies in its uncalibrated behavior; our adaptive methods do not require the prior identification of the object's deformation model and the camera's intrinsic/extrinsic parameters. This feature provides a way to automatically control deformations in a model-free manner. The experimental results that we report validate the feasibility of our controllers.},

This problem can be formulated as the reconstruction of a possibly discontinuous PWA map with a multi-dimensional domain. In order to achieve our goal, we provide an algorithm that exploits the combined use of clustering, linear identification, and pattern recognition techniques. This allows to identify both the affine submodels and the polyhedral partition of the domain on which each submodel is valid avoiding gridding procedures. Moreover, the clustering step (used for classifying the datapoints) is performed in a suitably defined feature space which allows also to reconstruct different submodels that share the same coefficients but are defined on different regions. Measures of confidence on the samples are introduced and exploited in order to improve the performance of both the clustering and the final linear regression procedure."

After discussing the main issues and difficulties connected with hybrid system identification, and giving an overview of the related literature, this paper focuses on four different approaches for the identification of switched affine and piecewise affine models, namely an algebraic procedure, a Bayesian procedure, a clusteringbased procedure, and a bounded-error procedure. The main features of the selected procedures are presented, and possible interactions to still enhance their effectiveness are suggested."

We prove that the set of all local solutions to this problem over all possible boundary conditions is a smooth manifold of finite dimension that can be parameterized by a single chart. We show that this chart makes it easy to implement a sampling-based algorithm for quasi-static manipulation planning. We characterize the performance of such an algorithm with experiments in simulation. }

	month = {04/2016},
	pages = {528-564},
	abstract = {Sampling-based algorithms are viewed as practical solutions for high-dimensional motion planning. Recent progress has taken advantage of random geometric graph theory to show how asymptotic optimality can also be achieved with these methods. Achieving this desirable property for systems with dynamics requires solving a two-point boundary value problem (BVP) in the state space of the underlying dynamical system. It is difficult, however, if not impractical, to generate a BVP solver for a variety of important dynamical models of robots or physically simulated ones. Thus, an open challenge was whether it was even possible to achieve optimality guarantees when planning for systems without access to a BVP solver. This work resolves the above question and describes how to achieve asymptotic optimality for kinodynamic planning using incremental sampling-based planners by introducing a new rigorous framework. Two new methods, Stable Sparse-RRT (SST) and SST*, result from this analysis, which are asymptotically near-optimal and optimal, respectively. The techniques are shown to converge fast to high-quality paths, while they maintain only a sparse set of samples, which makes them computationally efficient. The good performance of the planners is confirmed by experimental results using dynamical systems benchmarks, as well as physically simulated robots. },
